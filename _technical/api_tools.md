_Rae Davis wrote this topic for internal engineering teams in support of a documentation findability initiative. To improve discoverability and consistency among API documentation, Rae advocated that engineering teams use supported API documentation generation tools. This was to address customer feedback that it was unclear which tools were supported by the technical writing team. The writing sample has been altered to remove confidential information._
