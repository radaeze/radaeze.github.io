_Rae Davis wrote this topic for MySQL for Pivotal Platform at Pivotal Software. They interviewed SMEs and did independent research to gain the context that informed this document. They also created an original diagram to explain the cluster architecture. The final draft was copy-edited by a Product Manager._
