 ***Abstract:***

 Scholarship on religion in Octavia E. Butler's novels heavily skews towards a Judeo-Christin reading that ignores her fiction's radical nature. By examining Butler's Parable series through the lens of new religious movements, I argue that Butler's interest in religion is solely as an organizing principle to enact change through didactic texts. Butler intends for her religious invention, Earthseed, to serve as a model for religious activism in _Parable of the Sower_. In _Parable of the Talents_, Earthseed is a cautionary tale about the potential for authoritarianism embedded in faith. Looking at the Parable series through this lens provide the reader a praxis for living through political turmoil.
