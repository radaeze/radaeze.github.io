**Textris** is a cyberpunk, text adventure/Tetris mash-up. The game takes in a place in a dystopian future where Neo-Cold War agents have installed cybernetics modulations for their spy-craft. The player follows the story of such an agent as he explores a research facility, searching for mind alteration machine to turn the tides of war. Inspired by the Polybius urban legend, Textris replicates a retro arcade cabinet aesthetic and uses a Total Environmental Transcription/Reactive Information Synthesis, or T.E.T./R.I.S. system to control game play.
The game was originally submitted for Ludum Dare Jam 41 and was ranked in the top ten for the Theme and Innovation categories. The team used Twine to implement the branching narrative and Unity to control game-play and the UI. Ramia Davis worked on the game as a Writer, and Narrative Designer.
