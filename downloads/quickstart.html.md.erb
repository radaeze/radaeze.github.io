This topic describes how you can quickly get started with <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are required for a successful use of KSM:
+ **Install the <%= vars.product_short %> Tile:**
See [Download and Install the <%= vars.product_short %> Tile](installing.html#install).

+ **Install the <%= vars.product_short %> CLI (Command Line Interface) :**
See [Install the <%= vars.product_short %> CLI](installing.html#ksm).
+ A Kubernetes cluster

##<a id='cli'></a> Configure the CLI
1. Navigate to the **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard** >
**<%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>)** > **Credentials**.

1. Retrieve your **<%= vars.product_short %> API Credentials** by clicking **Link to Credentials**.

1. Configure environment variables by running the following commands:

    ```
    export KSM_TARGET=http://ksm.SYSTEM-DOMAIN
    export KSM_USER=USERNAME
    export KSM_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
    export KSM_INSECURE=true
    ```
    Where:
    + `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> system domain URL.
    + `USERNAME` is the value of `identity` you recorded in the above step.
    + `PASSWORD` is the value of `password` you recorded in the above step.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.product_short %> uses the above environment
    variables to set credentials and target your deployment.
    <code>KSM_INSECURE=true</code> enables <%= vars.product_short %> to ignore
     certificate validation.
     </p>

##<a id='register'></a> Register a Cluster
To register a cluster:

1. Create a cluster credentials yaml file with server, token, and caData. See [Create a Cluster Credentials File](managing-clusters.html#create-cluster-file).

1. Register a Kubernetes cluster with <%= vars.product_short %>  by running:

    ```
    ksm cluster register CLUSTER-NAME PATH-TO-CLUSTER-CREDS.YAML
    ```
    Where:
    + `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name <%= vars.product_short %> uses to track the cluster.
    Name must be lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
    + `PATH-TO-CLUSTER-CREDS.YAML` is the path to your cluster credentials file
    that you created in [Create a Cluster Credentials File](managing-clusters.html#create-cluster-file) above.


Set the cluster as the default:
Set a default cluster by running:

    ```
    ksm cluster set-default CLUSTER-NAME
    ```

    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of a cluster that is registered with <%= vars.product_short %>.

##<a id='offer'></a> Add an Example Offer
To add an offer to KSM, you can run the`ksm offer save` command. You can use any Helm chart. Let's use Bitnami's mysql chart.

Clone and package mysql:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/charts.git
helm package charts/bitnami/mysql
```

Save offer to KSM:
```bash
ksm offer save charts/stable/mysql-1.6.3.tgz
ksm offer list
```

List newly added offer:
```bash
ksm offer list
```
##<a id='access'></a> Enable Service Access for Offer
After you add your service offer, you must enable access.

To enable access to your service offer:

1. Log in to your <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) deployment by running:

    ```
    cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
    ```

    Where:
    + `API-URL` is the API endpoint for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> instance.
    + `USERNAME` is your username for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> instance.
    + `PASSWORD` is your password for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> instance.

    For more information,
    see [Getting Started with the cf CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login).

1. Enable access to the service for all orgs by running:

    ```
    cf enable-service-access SERVICE-NAME
    ```
    Where `SERVICE-NAME` is the name of the new service that you viewed in step 6 of
    [Add a Service Offering to <%= vars.product_short %>](#add) above.

1. View the newly created service plan by running:

    ```
    cf marketplace
    ```
