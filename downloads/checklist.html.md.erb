This topic describes how to minimally configure <%= vars.product_full %>
(<%= vars.product_short %>) for evaluation or testing purposes.
This topic does not include procedures for adding custom service offerings.


## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

To get started with <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. **Install and configure a Kubernetes cluster:**
  <%= vars.product_short %> supports <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> clusters. For information about
  <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>,
  see [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/index.html).
1. **Install and configure <%= vars.product_short %>:**
  See [Installing and Configuring <%= vars.product_short %>](./installing.html).
1. **Configure the <%= vars.product_short %> CLI:**
  See [Retrieve Credentials for KSM](./using.html#credentials).
1. **Register your Kubernetes cluster with <%= vars.product_short %>:**
    You can register clusters individually or set a default one.
    See [Register a Kubernetes Cluster](./managing-clusters.html#registering)
    or [Set a Default Kubernetes Cluster](./managing-clusters.html#set-default).
1. **Add an example service offering:**
  For evaluation or testing purposes,
  you can add the Bitnami MySQL chart to <%= vars.product_short %>.
  To add the Bitnami MySQL chart:
      1. Clone the `bitnami/charts` repo by running:

          ```
          git clone https://github.com/bitnami/charts.git
          ```
      1. Add the MySQL service offering by following the procedure in
          [Add a Service Offering to KSM](./using.html#add).
1. **Enable developer access to the service offering:**
  See [Enable Service Offering Access](.//using.html#enable).

After you follow the above procedure,
a developer can use Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) commands to
manage a MySQL service instance. This service instance runs on a Kubernetes cluster.

If you want to configure a custom service offering,
follow the procedures in [Configuring a Helm Chart](./configure-helm.html) and [Preparing a Service Offering](./prepare-offer.html).
