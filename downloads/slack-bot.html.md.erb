title: Adding a Slack Bot to a Concourse Pipeline
---

This topic explains how to add a bot that notifies a Slack channel of the build status
of a Concourse pipeline group.

The procedure in this topic has already been applied for the `cf-current` pipeline.
If you want to add the Slack bot to another pipeline,
you only need to do [Set and Update Pipeline](#set-update-pipeline).

## <a id= "resource"></a>Slack Notification Resource Overview

The Cloud Foundry Community organization provides a `slack-notification` resource type for
sending notifications to Slack.
To enable Slack notifications, you must add the code blocks below to
specific YAML files in the pipeline.

In the cf-docs pipelines
the YAML files that need to be edited are auto-generated when pipelines are updated.
When these YAML files are generated,
edits that were directly added to these files are overwritten.

To add code blocks to the necessary YAML files you must edit
`lib/pub_tools/scheme.rb` and `Rakefile`.
These files generate and configure specific YAML files in a pipeline.

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong> This procedure could be altered to add other
  custom resource types to Concourse pipelines.</p>

## <a id= "add-bot"></a>Adding the Slack Notification Resource

The following procedure is adapted from the
[Slack Notification tutorial](https://concoursetutorial.com/miscellaneous/slack-notifications/)
by Stark & Wayne.

### <a id= "add-webhook"></a> Set up Slack WebHook Integration

Slack provides an Incoming WebHook integration that can post messages from external sources to Slack.
You can add this integration to Concourse pipelines to send messages to Slack about their build status.

<br>

To set up the Slack WebHook:

1. Go to the Slack integration page for
[Incoming WebHooks](https://pivotal.slack.com/apps/new/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks)

1. Select the Slack channel that the bot should post to in **Integration Settings**

1. Record the provided Webhook URL

1. Customize the Name and Icon

1. **Save Settings**

1. Open `workspace/docs-concourse-creds/credentials.yml` in your text editor

1. Add the following code block to `credentials.yml`:

   ```
   slack-webhook: YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL
   ```

   Where `YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL` is the Webhook URL you recorded in step 3.

### <a id= "add-resource-type"></a> Add Slack Resource Type

You can configure the `slack-notification` resource type with the following code block:

```
resource_types:
- name: slack-notification
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: cfcommunity/slack-notification-resource
    tag: latest
```

You must add this code block to `pipeline.yml` for the Slack bot to work.
You can do this by editing the `Rakefile` in the `concourse-scripts-docs` directory.

<br>

To add the `slack-notification` resource type to the `pipeline.yml`:

1. Open `workspace/concourse-scripts-docs/Rakefile` in your text editor

1. Go to the following line:

     ```
     File.write(File.join(pipeline_name, 'pipeline.yml'), "# Generated file...\n" + yaml)
     ```

1. Add the `slack-notification` resource type code block to the code already present as follows:

```ruby
File.write(File.join(pipeline_name, 'pipeline.yml'), "# Generated file...\n" + yaml +
"resource_types:
- name: slack-notification
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: cfcommunity/slack-notification-resource")
```

### <a id= "add-resource"></a> Add Slack Resource

After you have added the `slack-notification` resource type,
you must add a resource of the `slack-notification` type.
In this example, this resource is named `notify`.

You can configure the `notify` resource with the following code block:

```
resources:
- name: notify
  type: slack-notification
  source:
    url: ((slack-webhook))
```

You must add this code block to `pipeline.yml` for the Slack bot to work.
You can do this by editing the `scheme.rb` in the `concourse-scripts-docs` directory.

<br>

To add the `notify` resource to the `pipeline.yml`:

1. Open `workspace/concourse-scripts-docs/lib/pub_tools/scheme.rb` in your text editor

1. Go to the `deploy_resources` definition

1. Add the `notify` resource to the code already present in the `deploy_resources` definition as follows:

```ruby
def deploy_resources
      [
        {
          'name' => 'concourse-scripts-bundle',
          'type' => 's3',
          'source' => {
            'bucket' => 'concourse-interim-steps',
            'versioned_file' => 'concourse-scripts-bundle.tar.gz',
            'private' => true,
            'access_key_id' => '{{aws-access-key}}',
            'secret_access_key' => '{{aws-secret-key}}'
          }
        },

        {
          'name' => 'notify',
          'type' => 'slack-notification',
          'source' => {
           'url' => '((slack-webhook))'
            }
        }

      ]
    end
```

Since `deploy_resources` requires a specific format,
the original `notify` resource YAML code must be reformatted to adhere to this requirement, as seen above.

### <a id= "add-step-hook"></a> Add Step Hooks

Concourse provides a `on_failure` step hook that runs when the parent step fails.
You can add a `on_failure` step hook to a bind or deploy task in a `plan.yaml` file.
When the task fails, the `notify` resource is triggered and will send a message to a Slack channel.

You can configure the `on_failure` step hook with the following code block:

```
on_failure:
    put: notify
    params:
      text: 'BOT-MESSAGE'
```
Where `BOT-MESSAGE` is the message that the Slack bot will post to a channel.

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong> For a descriptive message
  you can configure the bot message with Concourse metadata.
  For more information, see the Concourse CL Docs
  <a href="https://concourse-ci.org/implementing-resources.html#resource-metadata">Metadata section</a>.</p>

You must add the `on_failure` code block to `plan.yml` files for the Slack bot to work.
You can do this by editing the `scheme.rb` in the `concourse-scripts-docs` directory.

<br>

To add the `on_failure` step hook to `plan.yml` files:

1. Open `workspace/concourse-scripts-docs/lib/pub_tools/scheme.rb` in your text editor

1. Go to the `bind_plan` definition

1. Add the `on_failure` step hook code block to the code already present in the
`bind_plan` definition as follows:

     ```ruby
     def bind_plan
           aggregate = config.all_repos.map { |repo|
             { 'get' => repo.friendly_name, 'resource' => repo.full_name, 'trigger' => repo.trigger, 'params' => { 'submodules' => 'none' } }
           }

           aggregate << { 'get' => 'bookbinder-release', 'resource' => 'bookbinder-release-complete', 'trigger' => true }

           [
             { 'aggregate' => aggregate },
             { 'task' => "#{name}-bind", 'file' => "concourse-scripts/#{pipeline}/#{group}/#{name}-bind/task.yml",
             'on_failure' => {
               'put' => 'notify',
               'params' =>
                   {'text' => 'BOT-MESSAGE'}
             },
             { 'aggregate' =>
               [
                 { 'put' => s3_resource, 'params' => { 'file' => 'bind_output/final_app.tar.gz'} },
               ]
             }
           ]
         end
```

1. Add the `on_failure` step hook code block to the code already present in the `deploy_plan` definition
as follows:

     ```ruby
      def deploy_plan(environment, stream_id, dependency, trigger)
           previous_job = "#{name}-#{dependency}"
           environment = environment.gsub('-', '_')

           [
             {
               'aggregate' => [
                 { 'get' => 'concourse-scripts', 'resource' => 'concourse-scripts-docs-master', 'passed' => [previous_job]},
                 { 'get' => 'concourse-scripts-bundle' },
                 { 'get' => 'site-source', 'resource' => s3_resource, 'passed' => [previous_job], 'trigger' => trigger }
               ]
             },
             { 'task' => 'deploy', 'file' => 'concourse-scripts/deploy_task.yml', 'params' => {
               'DEPLOY_DETAILS' => "concourse-scripts/#{pipeline}/#{group}/config.yml",
               'DEPLOY_ENV' => environment,
               'BOOK_ID' => stream_id,
               'USERNAME' => "{{cloud-foundry-username}}",
               'PASSWORD' => "{{cloud-foundry-password}}"
             },
             'on_failure' => {
               'put' => 'notify',
               'params' =>
                   {
                     'text' => 'BOT-MESSAGE'}
             }
           }
           ]
         end
```

Since `bind_plan` and `deploy_plan` require a specific format, the original `on_failure`
step hook YAML code must be reformatted to adhere to this requirement, as seen above.

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong> Concourse also has a <code>on_success</code> step hook
  that runs only when a build is successful.</p>

### <a id= "set-update-pipeline"></a> Set and Update Pipeline
To apply these changes to `pipeline.yml` and the `plan.yml` files for a specific pipeline,
you must update and set the pipeline as follows:

1. Run the following command:

     ```
      rake scheme:update[PIPELINE/PIPELINE-GROUP]
     ```

    Where:
    * `PIPELINE` is the Concourse pipeline you are updating.
    * `PIPELINE-GROUP` is the Concourse pipeline group you are updating.

     Alternatively, to update all of the pipeline groups in a pipeline, run the following command:

      ```
      rake scheme:update_all[PIPELINE]
      ```

1. Run the following command:

     ```
     rake fly:set_pipeline[PIPELINE]
     ```

     Where `PIPELINE` is the Concourse pipeline from the previous step that you are setting.

1. Confirm that the new configurations to the pipeline are correct when prompted

1. Add, commit, and push the new configuration to Github
