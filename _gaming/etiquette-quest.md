Etiquette Quest follows Ruth Leigh, an outsider to the upper-class, as she attempts to win the hand of an elite, eligible bachelor. A branching narrative game, Etiquette Quest is played by adhering to the strict and often obscure demands of Victorian etiquette.

The game was originally submitted to GitHub's GameOff jam and was ranked in the top 100. Rae Davis worked on the game as a Researcher, Writer, and Narrative Designer.
